# RPG Character Sheet
 
Project started on July 2019 (don't remember when exactly) and finished on August 21, 2019.

Made with pure HTML, CSS and JS. No libraries used.

Funcionalities:
- add character's name
- choose gender
- random attributes points and a pool of 10 attribute points to use
- choose race and class (with their attributes modifiers)
- when race and/or class is selected description is shown
- all attributes have an impact on stats points (HP, Atk, Def, Mag)
- all stats points are recalculating when every change of attributes is made
- choose character portrait (12 males and 12 females - different races and classes)

Some descriptions were copied from wiki.
